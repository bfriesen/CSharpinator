# CSharpinator

[Click here if you have no idea what a CSharpinator and Dr. Doofenshmirtz might have to do with each other. Or if you just want to skip to the boring parts.](#the-boring-parts)

### Scene 1: Good morning, Agent P

```
Doo-bee doo-bee doo-bah
Doo-bee doo-bee doo-bah
Doo-bee doo-bee doo-bah
Perry!
```

*[SCENE: Agent P's lair. Major Monogram is on-screen, but Agent P is nowhere to be found.]*

**Major Monogram**: Carl, have you seen my keys?

**Carl, off camera**: I think so, sir. The last time I was them was --

*[Agent P interrupts as he whooshes into his lair, executing a perfect double back-flip, before landing on his chair in front of the O.W.C.A screen.]*

![Major Monogram](https://raw.github.com/wiki/bfriesen/CSharpinator/major_monogram.png)

**Major Monogram**: Ah, there you are. Good morning, Agent P. Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks again. It seems he has been downloading millions of documents from the internet, and it appears like all of the documents are eith xml or json. We first noticed something was fishy when our website's public-facing API went down. When we checked the logs, we saw that the person doing the attack was using the user name "Doof143". Sure enough, it was the evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz. We have no idea what he's doing with all the documents, but we're sure he's up to no good. Find out what he's is up to, and put a stop to it!

*[Agent P leaps out of his chair and activates his jetpack, zooming out of his lair.]*

*[Meanwhile, on-scree, Major Monogram reaches into his pocket and pulls out his keys.]*

**Major Monogram**: Oh, here they are. Carl, they were in my pocket the whole time.

**Carl**: What were in your pocket, sir?

**Major Monogram**: My keys, Carl. My keys.

**Carl**: I tried telling you, sir.

*[End scene with Agent P fling his jetpack out of his lair.]*
